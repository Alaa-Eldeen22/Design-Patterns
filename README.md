## Overview

Welcome to the Design Patterns Repository! Whether you're new to design patterns or looking to explore them further, this repository serves as a kick-off point for understanding and implementing design patterns in software development. Here, you will find information about various design patterns, along with Java and TypeScript implementations for each pattern.

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They define a common language for communicating design solutions efficiently among developers. By learning design patterns, developers can enhance their problem-solving skills and accelerate the design process. In this repository, we provide insights into the concept of design patterns, their classification, and practical implementations.

## What's a Design Pattern?

Christopher Alexander aptly describes design patterns as solutions to recurring problems, expressed in such a way that they can be reused infinitely. While Alexander refers to patterns in buildings and towns, the concept is equally applicable to object-oriented design. Design patterns encapsulate solutions to common problems in software design, expressed in terms of objects and interfaces. They provide a framework for addressing specific design challenges within a given context.

## Why Should I Learn Patterns?

Designing object-oriented software is challenging, especially when aiming for reusability and flexibility. Expert designers understand the value of reusing successful solutions rather than reinventing the wheel. Design patterns provide a means to reuse proven techniques, making them accessible to developers of new systems. By applying design patterns, developers can create more reusable and maintainable systems, ultimately accelerating the design process.

## Design Patterns Classification

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on the process of object creation. They provide various mechanisms for creating objects, ensuring flexibility and decoupling of the instantiation process from the rest of the system. Creational patterns include:

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition and class relationships, emphasizing how objects and classes can be combined to form larger structures. They enable the creation of flexible and efficient systems by defining ways to compose objects. Structural patterns include:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on defining algorithms and communication between objects. They facilitate the interaction and responsibility distribution among objects, promoting flexibility and maintainability. Behavioral patterns include:

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- [Observer](observer)
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

## Conclusion

In conclusion, design patterns offer proven solutions to common software design challenges. This repository is your starting point to explore and implement these patterns in your projects, encouraging better communication and collaboration among development teams.
